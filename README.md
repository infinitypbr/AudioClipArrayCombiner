# AudioClipArrayCombiner
This script will combine layers of clip arrays into every possible combination, with options for volume &amp; delay

You can purchase the Unity package on the Unity Asset Store or at InfinityPBR.com.  If you'd like to contribute, please do.

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS
* Get the Array function to work, so that the script will export every possible variation of the clips & layers.
